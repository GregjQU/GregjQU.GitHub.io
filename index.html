    <h1 class="glow">Hello!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p>My name is Gregory Jean-Baptiste and I am a Computer Science major.
    I was on a robotics team throughout my 4 years of high school and that inspired me to look into a career in the STEM field. 
    I originally enrolled as a mechanical engineering major during my freshman year but decided to transfer to the computer science major because I felt it would have been a better fit for me and I enjoyed learning how to code while in my previous engineering course.
    Although writing code could feel hard at times, the end result of making a functioning program is more satisfying than the minor stress that has occurred.</p>
